As far as I recall, fortifications against the monster attacks were built and an enormous network of mine tunnels was dug under the mountain. They found plentiful ore veins and the mine flourished. But their success didn't last long. It is said, unspeakable horrors overwhelmed the knights and miners of the King after a few years and the mine has been left abandoned ever since. However more and more of the most foul monsters are coming down the mountain since then and we have to fend them off. Otherwise, the Kingdom would be overwhelmed by their numbers. With the rise of undead knights in the castle and Lord Erwyn's demise, we struggle more and more.",

        "message":"A few months ago, everything changed. Suddenly, a violent earthquake shook the mountain and our railway tunnel to Prim collapsed. Pretty much at the same time, those Gornaud beasts attacked us and with all the trouble we're having, we haven't been able to restore the tunnel yet and our trade declines. There hasn't been any contact with Prim after this. Therefore, also less travellers are coming from Fallhaven and Nor City. It's a shame.",
