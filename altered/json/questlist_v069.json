The priests of Prim and BWMS who are both skilled in various magic rituals were researching on the ancient sanctuary east of Prim and found out that it is a Kazaulean artifact. The Kazaul are described as mighty demons who used to rule over the world in its early days and were banished by the light of Elythara and then largely forgotten with the rise of the Shadow. Anyway, the priests got excited about the Kazaulean sanctuary and performed a magic ritual, activating a portal in the sanctuary and creating a major earthquake, damaging the houses of Prim and making the tunnel to Stoutford collapse. They did their research in secret of their secular leaders.Soon after, the Gornauds and wyrms started appearing out of nowhere. Throdna suspects it has something to do with the portal which remains active. Both factions started blaming each other for the massive damage caused and this is how the rivalry between the two villages started."
